This project is a 1:1 Roblox-parity animation player with support for blending, fade time, numeric priorities, and a fair bit more. If you want to calculate the CFrame of a limb at a specific point in time, with a specific animation state, this library is for you.

## Disclaimer

This is pre-0.1.0 software. The API is very ugly, and there are dragons. Use cautiously.
